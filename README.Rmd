## Introduction

This is the repository for the code for the integrated modelling example for Isaac et al. (submitted), fitting a model for the black-throated blue warbler (_Setophaga caerulescens_) in Pennsylvania, USA. This is an extension of the analysis in @Miller2019. 

We use the following observation data:

-  Pennsylvania Breeding Bird Atlas point count data for part of Pennsylvania. This is taken straight from [the SI](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1111%2F2041-210X.13110&file=mee313110-sup-0001-supplementA.zip) of @Miller2019
- eBird data from 2006-2009, down loaded from GBIF, using the spocc package [@Spocc]
- North American BBS data [@NABBS] for 2005-2009

These data are in the Data directory.

For environmental data we use elevation and canopy cover, both imported directly into R

LEA, ADD DETAILS?

## Workflow

The workflow is as follows:

- extract the observation data, with [ExtractData.R](ExtractData.R). This has already been done, and hte results are the .csv files in Data/
- make the INLA stacks, using [MakeStacks.R](MakeStacks.R). This includes the covariate data, and creates some large objects that we don't save in this repository.
- Fit the model, with [FitWarblerModel.R](FitWarblerModel.R). This takes some time (overnight?), and creates another big .RData file.
- Look at and plot the results, with [WarblerResults.R](WarblerResults.R). This produces some maps
